# 2D Pathfinding Assessment

This repository showcases a 2D pathfinding solution using Python. It processes binary images to find the shortest path between two points and draws the path in red.

## Folder Structure
2D_paths-main/ # Input binary images
output_images/ # Output images with red path overlays
pathfinding_code.py # Python code implementing the solution
README.md # Project overview and instructions

## 📝 Description

- **2D_paths-main/**: Contains the original binary images used for the assessment.
- **output_images/**: Stores the output images with the detected path drawn in red.
- **pathfinding_code.py**: Main script that uses image processing and graph traversal to detect paths.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- `imageio` — for reading image files
- `numpy` — for matrix manipulation and binary image handling
- `collections.deque` — for implementing a BFS queue
